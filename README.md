# ViewTube
I developed a React-based video streaming platform called ViewTube, inspired by YouTube. The key technologies used include Redux for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and various APIs for suggestions and video data. ViewTube features a search suggestion functionality, allowing users to click on suggestions to view videos.
